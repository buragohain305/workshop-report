# Introduction

Before going to the designing part of a DAC ckt, we must know the need of an DAC/ADC ckt.

In general every signal around us are in analog form ,but for the signals to be analysed or processed by digital system we need to convert them into digital form. This is where the concept of DAC/ADC comes into picture.
