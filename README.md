# Introduction

Before going to the designing part of a DAC ckt, we must know the need of an DAC/ADC ckt.

In general every signal around us are in analog form ,but for the signals to be analysed or processed by digital system we need to convert them into digital form. This is where the concept of DAC/ADC comes into picture.

It is more efficient and substantially more accurate to do signal processing in the digital domain (i.e. the language used by computers). Ultimately though, things that interact directly with humans do so in the analog domain (i.e. humans hear sound, not ones and zeros). Therefore, the purpose of a DAC is to take digital domain signal processing results and convert them into a form that is directly or indirectly amenable to humans.

# An n-bit DAC

As the name implies n-bit DAC meaning it can take n-bit digital word as an input and convert them into analog signal in the form of voltage or current.
